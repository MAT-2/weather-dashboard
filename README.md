# Description

Creating a web application that takes multiple cities and displays their weather, along with forecast. It was fun challenging myself working with different APIs in order to produce results on a web page, especially when the forecast helps predict the weather based on existing weather patterns. I had difficulty retrieving the latitude and longitude needed to be used for retrieving data for the forecast per city inputted. If things worked out, I would have been able to populate the 5 next days' weather based on the city the user inputted.
